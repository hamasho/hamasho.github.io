My project has been very busy recently.
We are rewriting an existing website completely,
so I have to write a lot of code every day.
I’m exhausted, and my brain cells are dead.
So I couldn’t think much about how to organize my pull request (PR).

As a result, my PRs typically contain 500-1000 lines of code changes.
My team takes it very seriously to have a dedicated code review.
So my big PRs were apparently a big problem.

## How many lines should a PR have?

According to [this blog post](https://medium.com/@hugooodias/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-pull-request-567382bb6067),
and the original study at CISCO,
a review process is more effective if they review 200-400 lines of code.
He suggests that 250 lines of changes are a good standard.

I agree with that.
While I’m reviewing my coworker’s PRs,
I can focus on it only if it only contains less than 300 lines.
I don’t want to spend more than 30 mins on a single PR.
So 250 lines of changes are a reasonable standard
if I want to make the review process meaningful.

But it’s also possible that if I implement a complex function
for a single purpose,
the code and its test can exceed 400 lines.
In that case, it’s not a big problem.
Reviewers need to check the function’s logic precisely
but don’t have to spend much time on testing data and code.
In that case, I think it’s not wrong to have many changes.

So I decided to try to create a PR with less than 250 lines,
but sometimes allow having extra code if necessary.

## Why did my PR have more than 500 lines of changes?

I’m working on a frontend project developing a very UI-rich web app.
And it’s a complete rewrite of an existing project.

In many cases, my PR contains a fully-functional React component.
I complete the component so that it can run on
[storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) in all expected scenarios.
Therefore, the component itself is big and
sometimes comes with several child components,
utility functions, hooks, Redux integrations, and API requests.
It’s not surprising if the diff contains 5 or 10 hundreds of lines.

And when I started implementing, I often made optimistic assumptions.
I just joined this project one month ago
and am not familiar with the business domain.
It doesn’t help either that I’m not familiar with a lot of tools,
including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), storybooks,
react-hooks, etc, etc.
So I just can’t estimate how many things I need to add,
delete and change or how much it results.
In many cases, I even didn’t know what I have to do exactly.

Hence, I often started implementing first,
thinking like I need to create a single component and
maybe one or two util functions.
But then I realize I have to write some functions to fetch data from API,
add actions and manage state for Redux and so on.
The component is not that simple at all and
I need to split it into several child components.
Finally, when I create a PR, it contains nearly 1000 lines of changes.
My poor coworkers have to review it.
If it has a bad design or lacks some necessary features,
I have to rewrite it again.
So the update may also contain hundreds of lines,
and poor souls become more miserable…

I needed to stop doing this.

## How should I split my PR?

Here’s the strategy to make good PRs.

### 1. Understand the problem well.

Just like a lot of problems related to coding,
designing or managing projects,
this is the most important thing to keep a PR into a reasonable size.

If I don’t understand the problem well,
there’s no way I can estimate the required changes.
So it’s important to take enough time to explore the problem,
but it’s also required to communicate with other stakeholders
like devs, designers, or product owners, if possible
to understand why it’s required or if they have hidden requirements.

If I understand the problem and current codebase,
I’ll have a good sense of what I have to do.

### 2. Design precisely.

Now I can design the component.
Split several child components from the target component,
util and hook functions,
then write API interaction or Redux code if necessary.
Each function becomes a target for each PR,
so it should have a clear purpose.

This process is very important.
If I design in a wrong way, I’ll make several PRs
for the wrong components/functions.
The reviews for the wrong PRs may go well
if each PR has a clear purpose with enough documents and the code has no flaws.
But when I finally start implementing the target component,
it becomes clear that each sub-components are not designed correctly
and I have to create all PRs again…
It’s a big no-no, a complete waste of time.

We can reduce this risk by taking enough time and effort
for the design process.

### 3. Start implementation, and split or merge if necessary.

When I become to be confident enough in the design decisions,
it’s time to start implementing.
At this point, I should have some idea of what I have to do and
roughly how many lines it may be.
Or what existing functions I have to modify if necessary.

Even if I’ve taken the time for the system design,
sometimes the number of changes can be higher or less than I expected.
Then think about it again, and if necessary, split or merge the changes.
It’s not wrong to write a PR with more than 400 lines,
only if it’s logically a single unit
or a large number of changes are just test code.
But always think about the reviewers and avoid wasting the reviewers’ time.

### 4. Create a PR with sufficient documents and tests.

When I create a PR for util functions or child components,
it should be clear to reviewers what I want to accomplish.
Reviewers can’t test the fully-functional target component,
which is several PRs away from this,
so I need to add plenty of descriptions.
If necessary, write design documents,
describe how I split this problem,
and what each small component or function suppose to do.
Then reviewers have a good sense of those codes and can provide good reviews.

## Conclusion

A good PR should contain only 200-400 lines of changes and
concern only one or two functionalities.
The important things are to understand the original problem well
and spend enough time designing a solution.

After all, I just need to be a good programmer,
and enjoy coding and collaborating with coworkers!
