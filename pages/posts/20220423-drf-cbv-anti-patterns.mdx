# {meta.title}

Django REST framework (DRF) is a powerful web framework
developed top on battery-included Django framework.
Django provides great abstructions dealing with
databases, ORM, static files, templates and more.
But for a long time, web apps have inclined toward
single page application (SPA).
Django's ability to create HTML templates is not used as much as before.
Instead, we need to response in JSON format.
But Django doesn't provide much functionalities around this.

DRF provides several features to make it easy.
It has serializers/deserializers to become a bridge
between JSON representations and Django models.
